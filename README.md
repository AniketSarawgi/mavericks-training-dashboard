# Mavericks Training Dashboard
This repository is part of the **Mavericks Training Dashboard** initiative aimed at streamlining the onboarding process for new hires through an AI-agent-driven architecture.
 
## 📁 Branch Structure
The repository follows a modular development approach with **four dedicated branches**, each focusing on a specific functionality:
 
| Branch Name       | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `onboarding-agent`| Manages fresher onboarding schedules         |
| `assessment-agent`| Handles quizzes, coding scores, and feedback |
| `profile-agent`   | Maintains and updates fresher profiles       |
| `reporting-agent` | Generates comprehensive training reports     |
 
Each branch contains isolated functionality and respective code modules. These will be **merged into the `main` branch** once the web UI development is completed and integration is finalized.

## 🚧 Current Status 
The `main` branch is currently empty and will serve as the final integrated solution after merging all functional agents and the frontend UI.
Stay tuned for updates as we roll out the modules!
