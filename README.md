# Mavericks Training Dashboard
This repository is part of the **Mavericks Training Dashboard** initiative aimed at streamlining the onboarding process for new hires through an AI-agent-driven architecture.
 
## Branch Structure
The repository follows a modular development approach with **four dedicated branches**, each focusing on a specific functionality:
 
| Branch Name       | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| [`onboarding-agent`](https://github.com/AniketSarawgi/mavericks-training-dashboard/tree/onboarding_agent) | Manages fresher onboarding schedules         |
| [`assessment-agent`](https://github.com/AniketSarawgi/mavericks-training-dashboard/tree/assessment_agent) | Handles quizzes, coding scores, and feedback |
| [`profile-agent`](https://github.com/AniketSarawgi/mavericks-training-dashboard/tree/profile_agent)       | Maintains and updates fresher profiles       |
| [`reporting-agent`](https://github.com/AniketSarawgi/mavericks-training-dashboard/tree/reporting_agent)   | Generates comprehensive training reports     |
 
Each branch contains isolated functionality and respective code modules. These will be **merged into the `main` branch** once the web UI development is completed and integration is finalized.
